# TOP Node.js Course Project - Inventory Dashboard

06/16/2022 ~ 07/13/2022

## Objectives

Using express and heroku, create an inventory dashboard for an online business.

Your dashboard should include the following:

- Uses MongoDB as a database
- Categories for the items
- Users can create, read, update, and delete items and/or categories

Optional features:

- Allow users to upload images for items
- Password protect update and delete actions

## Learnings

Working with handlebars and express more for this project. I'm happy with getting all the CRUD functions hooked up with the database. I'm not too happy with the design of the site but want to keep moving on to the next project. Getting the site deployed and running on heroku took a few tries due to the environment variable for the database credentials.
